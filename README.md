## Studio 5 Portfolio

### Week One
In the first week we were introduced to Studio 5 and what projects and areas we could choose from. After going through the withdrawal process of Project 1 last semeseter I chose mobile applications, with the possiblity of web applications coinciding with it. 
The project that I am a part of is mentoring one group of high school students on their web application (possibly mobile too) with Rebecca. Erica and Charmaine will be a pair for another group.
Grayson sent us all a link to a vue.js tutorial, as that is what the high school students will be coding in. It was a bit difficult to get vue to create an app, after trying multiple tutorial versions of @vue/cli and changing the PATH destination Rebecca suggested to use npx @vue/cli create app.

### Week two
#### Stand up 
##### What went well:
Had Finished the Vue tutorial
##### What we are going to do:
I suggested we set up a git hub for not only my self and Rebecca towork on but for the team we will be helping. If they dont have git hub accounts that is perhaps something we could convince them to use so we can all collaborate together and see what they are working on and what issues they are having 

#### St Hildas Meeting
We went to meet the St Hildas girls groups. The groups gave small presentations of what their app design and what programs they'll be using. Rebecca and I will be helping (hopefully) the canteen app. I gave the girls my email address and i will get in touch with them about signing up for git hub, tutorial on using git hub and git bash, and once they get started on coding they can upload ther files.

 the girls got in contact with us and had some trouble with git. their was some miscommunication about meeting days, so taking advantage of their free time sooner we wanted to do a video call and work through git with them. 
 - miss communication via email, face to face is better thanks agile

#### video meeting.
On thursday 6/8 we had a video meeting on cisco webex and managed to get the girls started with git and git bash, showing them how to clone the repo from the command line. Our time was cut short due to wifi issues on their end. how ever we were able to screen share and show them where the github wiki is which is where we put some step by step instructions for them. 
- todo add images for them
- make virtual machine of mac
