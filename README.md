# Studio 5 Portfolio

### Week One
In the first week we were introduced to Studio 5 and what projects and areas we could choose from. After going through the withdrawal process of Project 1 last semeseter I chose mobile applications, with the possiblity of web applications coinciding with it. 
The project that I am a part of is mentoring one group of high school students on their web application (possibly mobile too) with Rebecca. Erica and Charmaine will be a pair for another group.
Grayson sent us all a link to a vue.js tutorial, as that is what the high school students will be coding in. It was a bit difficult to get vue to create an app, after trying multiple tutorial versions of @vue/cli and changing the PATH destination Rebecca suggested to use npx @vue/cli create app.

## Sprint 1
### Week two
#### Stand up 
##### What went well:
Had Finished the Vue tutorial
##### What we are going to do:
I suggested we set up a git hub for not only my self and Rebecca towork on but for the team we will be helping. If they dont have git hub accounts that is perhaps something we could convince them to use so we can all collaborate together and see what they are working on and what issues they are having 

#### St Hildas Meeting
We went to meet the St Hildas girls groups. The groups gave small presentations of what their app design and what programs they'll be using. Rebecca and I will be helping (hopefully) the canteen app. I gave the girls my email address and i will get in touch with them about signing up for git hub, tutorial on using git hub and git bash, and once they get started on coding they can upload ther files. 

#### Things to do 
- Reasearch Firebase
- Air Table
##### Tutorials I found

- [Reading](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
### Week 3
#### Stand up 
##### What went well:
Had the initial meeting with the St hildas Girls where they demonstrated their designs, and learnt about what software theyre going to use
##### What we are going to do:
compose email and send it all to them

 the girls got in contact with us and had some trouble with git. their was some miscommunication about meeting days, so taking advantage of their free time sooner we wanted to do a video call and work through git with them. 
 - miss communication via email, face to face is better

#### Video meeting.
On thursday 6/8 we had a video meeting on cisco webex and managed to get the girls started with git and git bash, showing them how to clone the repo from the command line. Our time was cut short due to wifi issues on their end. how ever we were able to screen share and show them where the github wiki is which is where we put some step by step instructions for them. 
Link to [wiki](https://github.com/kcharters89/Studio5-CanteenApp/wiki) that has been created for them. 
#### Things todo
- learn polipay , get it working with postman ? 
- get your vue hosted on firebase
- try firebase authentication

### Week 4
- PoliPay ?
- Hosted Weather app on Firebase [here](https://hostweatherapp.web.app/)
#### part two
- need to do firebase authentication
- the wiki for git 
- learnt that IT people do assume when giving directions for , documentation needs to not make assumptions and step by step it. 
- this will be helpful if i do the aged care volunteering 
##### week 4 is a bit of a write off due to covid lockdown changes

## Sprint 2
### Week 5
#### what went well? 
Got fire base app hosted 
#### what didnt go well ?
covid lockdown messed up my week with my anxiety
#### obsticles?
realise we may not have explained git so well

#### things to do
User stories added to sprints for rebecca and myself, the whole concept of using user stories and kanban while doing mentoring has been confusing as we've been taught through the whole degree its for coding projects for clients. But knowing we can use these as a way to keep track of what we're doing and keeping us on track is a great new way to use these technoligies we've already used.

- make a video explaining and showing github/ git bash

- fire base authentication

Due to the covid lockdown level 2 our face to face meeting was cancelled and postpone to the follow monday where would have the equipment to video call them and see how the students are doing. Now that they are using git hub a bit more we have noticed their file structure and naming conventions are all over the place. We need to ask them how their structure looks on their own computers and potentially teach them how to use branching in git so we can see their code and make comments.
