## Studio 5 Portfolio

### Week One
In the first week we were introduced to Studio 5 and what projects and areas we could choose from. After going through the withdrawal process of Project 1 last semeseter I chose mobile applications, with the possiblity of web applications coinciding with it. 
The project that I am a part of is mentoring? one group of high school students on their web application (possibly mobile too?) with Rebecca. Erica and Charmaine will be a pair for another group.
Grayson sent us all a link to a vue.js tutorial, as that is what the high school students will be coding in. It was a bit difficult to get vue to create an app, after trying multiple tutorial versions of @vue/cli and changing the PATH destination Rebecca suggested to use npx @vue/cli create app.

### Week two
#### Stand up 
##### What went well:
Most of us had looked at or done the Tutorial video. 
##### What we are going to do:
I suggested we set up a git hub for not only my self and Rebecca towork on but for the team we will be helping. If they dont have git hub accounts that is perhaps something we could convince them to use so we can all collaborate together and see what they are working on and what issues they are having 

### St Hildas Meeting
We went to meet the St Hildas girls groups. The groups gave small presentations of what their app design and what programs they'll be using. Rebecca and I will be helping (hopefully) the canteen app. I gave the girls my email address and i will get in touch with them about signing up for git hub, tutorial on using git hub and git bash, and once they get started on coding they can upload ther files. 

#### Things to do 
- Reasearch Firebase
- Get the girls to make github accounts
