## Sprint 1-2
During these sprints I took on a task that seemed simple enough of adding co2 to the heatmap site. I struggled immensely in this as it was like being thrown in the deep end with so many new concepts and languages and frameworks to learn.

To begin with the documentation of the room-sensors app was difficult to start with as it assumed a lot of previous knowledge. But after asking some group memebers I learnt how to :

- set up an environment with anaconda navigator 
[show examples]

- installing requirments 
- react front end with node 
- setting it up locally 
to gain a better understanding of the file structure i did a django tutorial because looking at the heatmap it wasnt that intuitive.
- wanting another bubble for co2 readings.
- friend helped with react if statement getting local co2 to display in the same bubble
- looking at react fragment to display two different bubbles , never got working 
- issues with sql migration files that a few weeks later others also had the same problem. 
- mqtt change to diplay real co2 data this is where i got stuck and a group memeber who was helping me made leaps and bounds because they knew the hardware side a lot better than myself and made leaps and bounds on the heatmap

## Sprint 3
after falling behind in the heatmap and not kniwing what was happening, i changed tot he ice rink app.
- set up django base from earlier tutorial.
- got local data base readings to show in a table
- added ice rink floor maps with a drop button to change between the two
- learning django static for images and js files.
- thinking of using ajaxfor post request but was told that was wrong because i dont understand ingest.
